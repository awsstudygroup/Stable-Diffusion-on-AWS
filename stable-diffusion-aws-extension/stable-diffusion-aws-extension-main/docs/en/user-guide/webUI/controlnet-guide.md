# Use Controlnet for inference

You can open **controlnet** sub-session, by combining the use of native functionalities **txt2img** or **img2img** along with the added panel of **Amazon SageMaker Inference** in the solution, the inference tasks involving cloud resources can be invoked.



## Controlnet User Guide

3. Click **Generate on Cloud** after finished all parameters setting.
4. Refresh and select the top Inference Job from **Inference Job: Time-Type-Status-Uid**, inference result will be displayed in **Output** section.
