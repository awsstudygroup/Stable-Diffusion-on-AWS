The Extension for Stable Diffusion on AWS solution helps customers migrate their existing Stable Diffusion model training, inference, and finetuning workloads from on-premises servers to Amazon SageMaker using extension and CloudFormation template. By leveraging elastic resources in the cloud, it accelerates model iteration and avoids performance bottlenecks associated with single-server deployments.

This implementation guide provides an overview of the solution, its reference architecture and components, considerations for planning the deployment, configuration steps for deploying the solution to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.
